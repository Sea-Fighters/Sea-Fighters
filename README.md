# Sea-Fighters
Sea Fighters is an arcade videogame settled in the sea. For this task it has been used mainly the
three.js library. In the three.js library there is not a physical engine which allows us to manage
the gravity and the various collisions, and thus, in order to achieve this target, we have used the
Raycaster class available in the three.js library. For the environment we have imported some .obj
files regarding the islands, the player ship, the enemy ship and the bullets. In addiction we have
created others enemies which are based on hierarchical models. The main idea behind the game
mode is a very simple one, i.e. you have to destroy all the enemies ships by avoiding your health
bar get reset.

## Gameplay
The user is on a boat in the middle of the ocean, surrounded by islands and enemies. The aim of the game is to kill the enemies before being killed. You earn points every time you hit an enemy. The user can make the ship move by pressing the keyboard keys (W, A, S, D) and shoot the missiles by pressing 'space'.
Earn as many points as you can!

Nothing is more exciting in life than seeing yourself shoot and not be hit.
